- Build up and style the readingDiv
DONE clicking on the cardDiv should reveal the card (flip over animation later)
DPNE clicking on the cardDiv also reveals the name and the first paragraph of the text with a read more button
DONE clicking the read more button should reveal the next parapgraph (on the last one the button should disappear)
- The title, keywords and first paragraph should appear with some animation

Later:
- Revealing the cards and the text below only works with one card. Refactor it so it will work with 3 cards or even more
