- Build up and style the readingDiv
- clicking on the cardDiv should reveal the card (flip over animation later)
- clicking on the cardDiv also reveals the name and the first paragraph of the text with a read more button
DONE clicking the read more button should reveal the next parapgraph (on the last one the button should disappear)

Later:
- Revealing the cards and the text below only works with one card. Refactor it so it will work with 3 cards or even more
